# Hospital Management System (C++)

## Project Overview

The **Hospital Management System** is a C++ application designed to simulate the core operations of a hospital. This system allows for the management of patient records, handling emergency patient queues, tracking treatment histories, and managing critical patients. The application uses a variety of data structures, including linked lists, stacks, queues, and heaps, to efficiently manage different hospital operations.

### Key Features:
- **Patient Record Management**: Allows adding, viewing, and managing patient information.
- **Emergency Queue Management**: Supports adding emergency patients to a queue and processing them.
- **Treatment History**: Records and displays treatments given to patients.
- **Critical Patient Queue**: Manages a priority queue for critical patients, based on severity.
